| Operator     | Description                | Illustration                                                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | |
| : -------:   | :-------------------       |       :---------------------------------------------:        | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | |
| `.`          | direct precedence          | ![](images/A-pred-B.svg)                                     | For non-terminal nodes, precedence is determined by the right-most and left-most terminal children. In corpora with multiple segmentations the layer on which consecutivity holds may be specified with `.layer`                            | |
| `.*`         | indirect precedence        | ![](images/A-pred-ind-B.svg)                                 | For specific sizes of precedence spans, `.n,m` can be used, e.g. `.3,4` - between 3 and 4 token distance; the default maximum distance for `.*` is 50 tokens. As above, segmentation layers may be specified, e.g. `.layer,3,4`             | |
| `^`          | directly near              | ![](images/A-pred-B.svg) or ![](images/B-pred-A.svg)         | Same as precedence, but in either order. In corpora with multiple segmentations the layer on which consecutivity holds may be specified with `^layer`                                                                                       | |
| `^*`         | indirectly near            | ![](images/A-pred-ind-B.svg) or ![](images/B-pred-ind-A.svg) | Like indirect precedence in either order. The form `^n,m` can be used, e.g. `^3,4` - between 3 and 4 token distance; the default maximum distance for `^*` is 50 tokens. As above, segmentation layers may be specified, e.g. `^layer,3,4`  | |
| `>`          | direct dominance           | ![](images/A-dom-B.svg)                                      | A specific edge type may be specified, e.g. `>secedge` to find secondary edges. Edge labels are specified in brackets, e.g. `>[func="OA"]` for an edge with the function 'object, accusative'                                               | |
| `>*`         | indirect dominance         | ![](images/A-dom-ind-B.svg)                                  | For specific distance of dominance, `>n,m` can be used, e.g. `>3,4` - dominates with 3 to 4 edges distance                                                                                                                                  | |
