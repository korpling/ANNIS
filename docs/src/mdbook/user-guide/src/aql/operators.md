# Complete List of Operators

AQL currently includes the following operators:

| Operator          | Description                | Illustration                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| : -------:        | :-------------------       | :---------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.`               | direct precedence          | ![](/images/A-pred-B.svg)                               | For non-terminal nodes, precedence is determined by the right-most and left-most terminal children. In corpora with multiple segmentations the layer on which consecutivity holds may be specified with `.layer`                            |
| `.*`              | indirect precedence        | ![](/images/A-pred-ind-B.svg)                           | For specific sizes of precedence spans, `.n,m` can be used, e.g. `.3,4` - between 3 and 4 token distance; the default maximum distance for `.*` is 50 tokens. As above, segmentation layers may be specified, e.g. `.layer,3,4`             |
| `^`               | directly near              | ![](/images/A-pred-B.svg) or ![](/images/B-pred-A.svg)          | Same as precedence, but in either order. In corpora with multiple segmentations the layer on which consecutivity holds may be specified with `^layer`                                                                                       |
| `^*`              | indirectly near            | ![](/images/A-pred-ind-B.svg) or ![](/images/B-pred-ind-A.svg)  | Like indirect precedence in either order. The form `^n,m` can be used, e.g. `^3,4` - between 3 and 4 token distance; the default maximum distance for `^*` is 50 tokens. As above, segmentation layers may be specified, e.g. `^layer,3,4`  |
| `>`               | direct dominance           | ![](/images/A-dom-B.svg)                                | A specific edge type may be specified, e.g. `>secedge` to find secondary edges. Edge labels are specified in brackets, e.g. `>[func="OA"]` for an edge with the function 'object, accusative'                                               |
| `>*`              | indirect dominance         | ![](/images/A-dom-ind-B.svg)                            | For specific distance of dominance, `>n,m` can be used, e.g. `>3,4` - dominates with 3 to 4 edges distance                                                                                                                                  |
