# Installation

There are two editions of ANNIS, one for the local use on a standard computer (ANNIS Kickstarter) and one which is only needed when running a web-server. 
Both versions require the Installation of Java OpenJDK 8.
If your operating system does already include Java. we recommend the installation of the open-source and free of charge installers provided at [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
