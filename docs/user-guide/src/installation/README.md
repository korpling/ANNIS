# Installation

There are two editions of ANNIS, one for the local use on a standard computer (ANNIS Desktop) and one which is only needed when running a web-server. 
Both versions require the Installation of Java OpenJDK 11.
If your operating system does not already include Java, we recommend the installation of the open-source and free of charge installers provided at <https://adoptium.net/>.
