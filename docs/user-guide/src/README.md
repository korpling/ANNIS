# Introduction

ANNIS is an open source, browser-based search and visualization architecture for
multi-layer corpora, developed at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, Georgetown
University and Potsdam University. It can be used to search for complex graph
structures of annotated nodes and edges forming a variety of linguistic structures, such as constituent or dependency syntax trees, coreference, rhetorical structure and parallel alignment edges, span annotations and associated multi-modal data (audio/video).
