# Importing and Configuring Corpora

Before a corpus can be used in ANNIS, it has to be imported once.
This section describes how you can create corpora for ANNIS from existing
corpora in different formats, how you import it and various corpus-related configuration options.

ANNIS consists of a front-end web-application and a back-end service.
In the Kickstarter version, both components are combined into one application.
The behavior of these components can be customized changing their configuration.
