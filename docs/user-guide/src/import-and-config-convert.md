# Converting Corpora for ANNIS using Pepper

ANNIS uses a relational database format called relANNIS. 
Before a corpus can be imported into ANNIS, it has to be converted into this format.
The Pepper converter framework allows users to convert data from various formats including PAULA XML,
EXMARaLDA XML, TigerXML, CoNLL, RSTTool, generic XML and TreeTagger
directly into relANNIS. 
Further formats (including Tiger XML with secondary edges,
mmax2) can be converted first into PAULA XML and then into relANNIS using the
converters found on the ANNIS downloads page.
