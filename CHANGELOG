Version 2.3.0
=============

TODO

Version 2.2.0
=============

enhancements:

* Corpus browser feature
* Gridview allows resolver mappings to determine order of layers
* Query history
* Keyboard Shortcut to "Show Results" (CTRL-ENTER)
* Possible context size settings configurable
* Login timeout removed in Kickstarter
* Schema improvements, especially for corpora with a lot of annotations per 
  node (like token annotations)
  
bugfixes:

(#105) Queries with two different components for same node don't work
(#121) Coref vis highlights tokens from wrong namespace
(#118) Negative regex search doesn't assume initial ^ and final $
(#124) NullPointerException in annis.WekaHelper.exportAsArff
(#126) Query builder should suggest anno-names only from selected corpora
(#130) Time outs on comparatively simple precedence queries in Falko
(#137) Citation with "(" is handled wrong
(#69) whitespacenormalisation of \t in AQL queries
(#135) "Add node" in the query builder should look like a button, not a menu

other:
 Semantics of >@l and >@r clarified (now returns all children of a node aligned with its leftmost or rightmost covered tokens; in special cases of graphs with multiple parentage this may lead to multiple hits per parent!)

Version 2.1.8
=============

enhancements:

* partitioning of the database table
 - this allows much faster import of new corpora, even if there are already
   big corpora in the database
 - some performance improvement since the database tables to load are smaller
 - performance of smaller corpora is not affected by bigger corpora
* improved query speed on queries returning large result sets dramatically
* new and much extended version of the coreference visualizer
* negation of meta-data
* the pointing relation "->" operator is now able to specify the range "-> m,n"
* dependency visualizers 
  - a general dependency visualizer based on the work of Kim Gerdes and the
    Vākyārtha annotation project
  - specialized version for the PROIEL corpus 
  (this work was sponsored by the PROIEL project at the University of Oslo) 
* the "new" partitur visualizer is now able to display overlapping spans so the
  old version is obsolete and can be replaced
* highlight the matches belonging to different parts of the query in different
  colors, especially helpful if you query something like cat="S" & tok & #1 > #2
* cache for resolver entries for faster display of the results
* text exporter which is exporting the the token annotations
* Kickstarter displays current status/step while importing
* Citations Links should use corpus name, not number
* Trigger timeout is now only controlled by the database (no extra timeout for
  frontend)

bugfixes:

* general cleanup in the code
* fix bug that didn't allow "+" to be used in exporters
* don't throw an exception if you search for a metadata value that does not
  exist in the corpus (just deliver 0 results)
* more escaping of user input in SQL
* updated to the latest version (3.3.0) of the ExtJS JavaScript-Framework 
* fixed some size issues in the GUI
* trigger the timeout only in the database, not in the JavaScript GUI
* fixed bug where invalid queries where accepted when using the negation in
  combination with tok
* leaking JDBC connections were removed during import, this caused some problems
  during import of multiple corpora with Kickstarter if the maximum connection
  number of Postgres was too restrictive
* Resolver does not trigger on edge_namespace alone


Version 2.1.7
=============

* Negation of word forms (e.g. in the pcc2 demo corpus: tok!=”in”), of attribute
  values (pos!=”NN”) and of edge labels
  (cat=”S” & cat=”PP” & #1 >[func!=”MO”] #2).
* Configurable namespaces and display names for visualizers, allowing e.g. 
  multiple tree visualizations for multiple parses etc. (see attached user 
  guide).
* Preliminary support for parallel corpora: parallel corpora are now importable
  and alignments on all levels can be searched for; there is as yet no 
  visualization for the alignment edges – results with multiple languages are 
  arranged under each other in the KWIC view with hit elements highlighted 
  (see ANNIS site for a picture).
* Pointing relations can now carry both types and labels, allowing for both 
  annotated dependency trees (e.g. relations like #1 ->dep[func="DET"] #2 are 
  searchable, though there is no special visualization for them yet) and labeled
  alignments (e.g. for “fuzzy” vs. “good” alignment etc.).
* A new basic KWIC exporter in the export tab (just the matched tokens with 
  context, in plain text)
* Acceleration and parallelization of certain queries (as a side effect, a first
  page of hits may now be retrieved before the complete match count is 
  calculated)
* Improvements in the behavior of resizing, highlighting and scrollbars in 
  visualizers
* Various bug fixes
