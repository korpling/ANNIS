<h2>Searching for Word Forms</h2>
<p>
To search for word forms in ANNIS, simply select a corpus (in this
example the small PCC2 demo corpus) and enter a search string between
double quotation marks, e.g.:</p>
<tt>"statisch"</tt>
<p>Note that the search is <strong>case
sensitive</strong>, so it will not
find cases of capitalized 'Statisch', for example at the beginning of a
sentence. In order to find both options, you can either look for one
form OR the other using the pipe sign ( <tt>|</tt>
):
</p>
<tt>"statisch" | "Statisch"</tt>
<p>or else you can use <strong>regular
expressions</strong>, which must be
surrounded by slashes ( <tt>/</tt>
) instead of quotation marks:</p>
<tt>/[Ss]tatisch/</tt>
<p>To look for a sequence of
multiple word forms, enter your search terms separated by <tt>&amp;</tt>
and then specify that the relation between the elements is one of <strong>precedence</strong>,
as signified by the period ( <strong><tt>.</tt></strong>
) operator:</p>
<tt>"so" &amp; "statisch"
&amp; #1 . #2</tt>
<p>The expression <tt>#1
. #2</tt> signifies that the first
element ("so") precedes the second element ("statisch"). For <strong>indirect
precedence </strong>(where other
tokens may stand between the search terms), use the <strong><tt>.*</tt></strong>
operator:</p>
<tt>/[Ss]o/ &amp; "statisch"
&amp; "wie" &amp; #1 . #2 &amp; #2 .* #3 </tt>
<p>The above query finds sequences
beginning with either "So" or "so", followed directly by "statisch",
which must be followed either directly or indirectly (.*) by "wie". A
range of allowed distances can also be specified numerically as follows:</p>
<tt>/[Ss]tatisch/ &amp; "wie"
&amp; #1 .1,5 #2</tt>
<p>Meaning the two words may
appear at a distance of 1 to 5 tokens. The operator <tt>.*</tt>
allows a distance of up to 50 tokens by default, so searching with <tt>.1,50</tt>
is the same as using <tt>.*</tt>
instead. Greater distances (e.g. <tt>.1,100</tt>
for 'within 100 tokens') should always be specified explicitly.</p>
<p>
Finally, we can add metadata restrictions to the query, which filter
out documents not matching our definitions. Metadata attributes must be
preceded by the prefix meta:: and may not be bound (i.e. they are not
referred to as #1 etc. and the numbering of other elements ignores
their existence):
</p>
<tt>
/[Ss]tatisch/ &amp; "wie" &amp; #1 .1,5 #2 &amp; meta::Genre="Sport"
</tt>
<p>To view metadata for a search result or for a corpus, press the "i"
icon next to it in the result window or in the search form
respectively.
