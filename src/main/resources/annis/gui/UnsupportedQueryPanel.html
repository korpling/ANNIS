		<h1>Unsupported query for citation link</h1>
		<p>
			The query referenced by the citation link you followed is not
			supported properly by this version of ANNIS. We are sorry for the
			inconvenience and ask you to file a bug report at <a
				href="https://github.com/korpling/ANNIS/issues">https://github.com/korpling/ANNIS/issues</a>
			with the original citation link and where you found it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want, you can still try to execute the query. <strong>This
				will probably give you different results than the ones originally
				referenced by this link or not even give any results at all.</strong>
